Welcome to the application repository!

This is a simple web application developed using ASP.NET Core MVC that provides essential features and functionalities for user management and access control. Here's what you can expect from this application:

1. User Registration: Users can register and create their accounts, providing necessary information for authentication and access.

2. User Login: Registered users can securely log into the application using their credentials, ensuring personalized access and data protection.

3. User Role Management: The application supports three distinct user roles: Administrator, User, and Staff. Each role has specific privileges and access levels.

4. Admin / User / Staff Dashboard: The application features dedicated dashboards for administrators, users, and staff members. These dashboards provide a centralized interface for managing user-related activities and data.

Additional Functionalities:
1. Administrator Control: The admin user has complete control over the application. They can perform actions like adding, editing, and deleting user information provided by users.

2. Staff Limited Access: Staff members have limited access and can perform actions such as adding and editing user information provided by users. They do not have complete control like the admin user.

3. User Limited Access: Users have limited access and can only add or change their own information. They do not have access to other users' information.

This application serves as a starting point for building a user management system with role-based access control. It leverages the power of ASP.NET Core MVC, providing a robust and scalable framework for web development.
